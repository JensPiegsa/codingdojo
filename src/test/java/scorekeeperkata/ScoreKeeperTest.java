    Problem

We need software to deliver the proper data to the scoreboard for a basketball team. Unfortunately the people using our software are not the brightest lights under the sun, so they need six buttons (each team can score either 1, 2 or 3 points with a single shot).
Your Task

Write a class ScoreKeeper which offers following methods:

void scoreTeamA1()
void scoreTeamA2()
void scoreTeamA3()
void scoreTeamB1()
void scoreTeamB2()
void scoreTeamB3()
String getScore()

     */
